        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            After graduating college with a B.A. in history, I worked as an administrative assistant for an orthopedic practice. From there, my interest in technology grew and I became their onsite technical support where I got my A+ certification. Unfortunately, there wasn't much growth and was hired on by Reliable IT to continue my career in tech.

        <p>
            While working at Reliable IT, I came to realize that I had a passion for creating something new. I enjoyed building and configuring workstations, but it wasn't quite what I was looking to do. My friends, who are web developers, suggested I look into coding. I took a few free online courses and I fell in love with it! 
        </p>

        <p>
            I enjoy the idea of creating, problem solving, and tinkering with code. After much reflection, I realized this was the career path that I wanted to pursue and I'm currently enrolled in a bootcamp to become a Full Stack Enginner.
