    <img src="./images/profile-pic2.JPG" width="200px"/>
    <p>After graduating college with a B.A. in History, I spent 2 1/2 years as a desktop support technician. After much reflection, 
        I decided being a desktop support technician was not the career path for me. I realized that I enjoyed the idea of creating, 
        problem solving, and tinkering with what I built. I decided pursing a career as a Full Stack Software Engineer was the right 
        path for me and I'm currently enrolled in Flatiron School's Software Engineering program.</p>
